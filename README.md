I <3 Vim:

- If you like Vim too, you should check out the website that critics are calling &ldquo;[actually fun to read for its own sake!](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/134m0qw/normal_mode_a_new_vim_website_articles_tips/jj3q13b/)&rdquo; and &ldquo;[the coolest thing ever!](https://mastodon.social/@joeklemmer/110502643372729936)&rdquo;

  [Normal Mode](https://normalmo.de/) is my love letter to Vim.
- [A recursive Vim macro to calculate numbers in the Fibonacci sequence](https://normalmo.de/posts/recursive-macro/)
- [Conway's Game of Life, implemented as a Vim Macro](https://normalmo.de/vimlife/)
